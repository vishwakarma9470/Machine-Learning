# 💡 Wafer Fault Detection System

### 📑 Project Overview
In electronics manufacturing, a **wafer** (also known as a slice or substrate) is a thin layer of semiconductor material like crystalline silicon (c-Si), used as the foundation for building integrated circuits (ICs) and solar cells. These wafers undergo complex microfabrication processes such as doping, ion implantation, etching, thin-film deposition, and photolithographic patterning. After fabrication, the wafers are diced into individual chips and packaged.

This project focuses on **automated wafer fault detection** using machine learning to identify defective wafers in the manufacturing process. The model predicts whether a wafer is faulty (`-1`) or normal (`1`).
